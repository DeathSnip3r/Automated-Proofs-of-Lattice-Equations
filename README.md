# Automated-Proofs-of-Lattice-Equations
This repository accompanies a research project of an empirical study of automated decision procedures for lattice equations. It implements and benchmarks four algorithms, namely Whitman, Freese, Cosmadakis, and Hunt, against synthetically generated term pairs under controlled structural parameters.
